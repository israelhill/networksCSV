My program is called csvReader.py
The tcp dump for the 10 sites I visited is called: dump.csv

To run the program, enter:

    python csvReader.py dump.csv

This will produce a new file called output.txt with a list of all the
IP addresses I encountered when visiting the 10 sites. The average RTT for
each IP is listed directly below the IP addresses.
